1). Create a program that launches two goroutines. 
One of the goroutines should print out "hello" every 1 second, and the other goroutine should print out "world"
 every 2 seconds. The program should terminate after 10 seconds.

2). Write a program that uses goroutines to calculate the sum of an array of integers. 
The program should divide the array into four equal parts and launch a goroutine to calculate the sum of each part.
 The program should wait for all the goroutines to complete and then calculate the final sum.

3). Write a program that launches ten goroutines, 
each of which generates a random number between 1 and 100 and sends it to a channel.
 The program should then print out the sum of all the numbers received from the channel.

4). Write a program that launches two goroutines. 
One of the goroutines should generate random numbers between 1 and 100 and send them to a channel.
 The other goroutine should read numbers from the channel and print out whether the number is even or odd.

5). Write a program that launches a goroutine to listen to a channel for incoming strings. 
Whenever a string is received, the goroutine should print out the string with a timestamp. 
The program should then send 10 strings to the channel and terminate.
